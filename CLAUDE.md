## Project rules

- Spec is `DESIGN.md`. Read it before changing behaviour; keep it current.
- `src/` is plain JavaScript for the Apps Script V8 runtime: classes, arrow
  functions, destructuring, optional chaining and `??` are fine. No
  `import`/`export`, no `#private` fields, no static class fields, no
  top-level code that references another file. Files share one global scope.
  Extension files under `src/ext/<Name>/` follow the same rules; the core
  reaches an extension only through `<prefix>_<hook>` functions probed at
  call time (DESIGN 8, Extensions), never the other way round.
- Zero dependencies, runtime or dev. No `package.json`, no `npm install`.
  Tests use `node --test` (Node 24). Any new dependency needs the owner's
  explicit approval.
- `./test.sh` must pass before every commit. Run `./build.sh` before every
  commit that touches `src/`: `dist/` is committed and must match `src/`,
  and `./test.sh` checks this.
- Comments: brief, only where code is not self-explanatory. No narrative.
- Temporary files go in `./.tmp/`, never committed. Never push.


## Task tracking

Use the `plan` CLI for ALL task tracking. Do not use TodoWrite or TaskCreate.

* `dispatch-with-plan` from `.claude/plugins/claude-plan/skills/dispatch-with-plan/SKILL.md`
* `team-with-plan` from `.claude/plugins/claude-plan/skills/team-with-plan/SKILL.md`

### When to apply

Apply the skill whevener any planning or task tracking is needed.

Don't create plan tickets while still brainstorming/discussing — wait until actual design or implementation work begins.
If unsure whether the user is past brainstorming, ask before creating tickets.

### Before starting work
- Break the task into tickets: `plan create 'title="Step name"'`
- For subtasks: `plan create PARENT 'title="Subtask"'`
- Create tickets in preferred execution order (or reorder with `plan move`)
- Put details in each subtask body (`plan N add "what to do"`), not as a TODO list in the parent
- Review the breakdown: `plan list`

### While working
- Before starting a ticket: `plan N status in-progress`
- After completing a ticket: `plan N close`
- Add notes when useful: `plan N comment add "What happened"`
- If new work surfaces: `plan create PARENT 'title="New task"'`
- If a task is unnecessary: `plan N close wontfix`
- Check what's next: `plan list ready` or `plan list order`

### Reporting progress
- Show status: `plan list --format 'f"{indent}#{id} [{status}] {title}"'`

### Merging branches
Plan files merge automatically when the git merge driver is installed (`plan install git`): `git merge`/`rebase` reconciles them structurally. If a merge reports a **conflict** in a plan file, the driver left a `<file>.reject` sidecar (the plan file itself stays valid, defaulting to your side) — there are no `<<<<<<<` markers to hand-edit. Finish it: edit each block in the `.reject` to keep ONE side (`--- to ---` or `--- from ---`), then `plan merge --resolve && git add <file>` — or `plan merge --abort` to discard. Merge another branch's plan manually with `plan merge <branch>`; recover a file already broken by raw conflict markers with `plan resolve`.

### For subagents / team workers
When dispatching subagents, you are the coordinator — do not implement tickets yourself.

Include these instructions in the subagent prompt:
- Find your tasks: `plan 'assignee == "YOUR-NAME" and is_open' list`
- View a task: `plan N`
- Structured view of subtasks: `plan N -r ls`
- Subtasks in execution order: `plan N -r ls order`
- Start work: `plan N status in-progress`
- Add notes: `plan N comment add "Description of what you did"`
- Complete: `plan N close`
- Check for more: `plan list ready` or `plan list order`
- Create subtasks if needed: `plan create PARENT 'title="Subtask", assignee="YOUR-NAME"'`
